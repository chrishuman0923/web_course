# HTML

## Instructions

In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

- DOCTYPE declaration
- Head tag with a title tag
- H1 tag with a title of your choice
- Embed an image
- Create the following three links on your page:

  - One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
  - Make the second link bold.
  - Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.

- HINT: You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :P

## BONUS

- Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
- Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
