# JS Content

## Instructions

- Using the html file as a starting point:

  - Link the external js file to the html file.

  - Add the missing code such that your JavaScript generates HTML content that displays all of the drink options.

### HINT

- You will need a for-loop. Inside your for-loop you will need to use each of the following methods: `createElement`, `.textContent`, and `.appendChild`.

### BONUS

- Convert the array of strings to an array of objects. Each object should have a `name` property and a `price` property. The `name` property should be the name of the drink and the `price` property should be the price of the drink.
