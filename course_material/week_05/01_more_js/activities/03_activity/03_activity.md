# JS Sandwich Click

## Instructions

- Add the missing js code (and file) such that clicking any of the sandwiches causes…

  1. An alert message to pop-up saying something snarky about the sandwich type.

  2. A second alert message that displays to the user the number of that specific sandwich they’ve eaten.

### HINT

- You will need counter variables.

### BONUS

- Add an image to an `image-div` on the click event.
