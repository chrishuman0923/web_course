# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Instructions

- Using the pseudo code you made in the previous activity, write the code for the game.

- **NOTE:** A `for-loop` is not technically necessary to make our RPS game, but could be used. Focus on the topics we have just covered when thinking about how to build out the game.

- **NOTE:** Donâ€™t use `document.write` as it will delete the contents of your page including your JavaScript. Use `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById`, alongside either `innerHTML` or `textContent`, to write to the DOM.

- **NOTE:** Don't worry. I know this is a very challenging assignment. I also know that you won't know where to start. In fact, I haven't shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that's okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error.
