# Trivia Game

## Instructions

- Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows:

  `{ question: "QUESTION", answer: "ANSWER" }`

- Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting t (for true) or f (for false).

- Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

### Bonus

Keep track of the user's score.

### HINT

Don't worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working code first.
